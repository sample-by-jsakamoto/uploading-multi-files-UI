## What's this?

This is experimental sample code of multiple files uploading UI that is implemented by **AngulaJS** with **TypeScript**. (Server side is implemented by **C# + ASP.NET MVC**)

This UI increase/decrease input:file elements dynamically, and controll enable/disable state of 'Upload' button.

## Live demo

> (*) Uploading feature does not work because it is only static GitHub pages.

## Notice

You should consider well about another UI, such as HTML5 multiple selection input:file attribute, or HTML5 file drug & drop API.
